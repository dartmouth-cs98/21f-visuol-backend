This is the backend code for the CS98 project VisuOL developed during the 21F and 22W.

## Architecture

TODO:  descriptions of code organization and tools and libraries used

So far, we are using Python and Flask for our backend. We are planning to use MongoDB for our backend.

## Setup

TODO: how to get the project dev environment up and running, npm install etc

For setting up flask, first you need to have an up to date version of python and then use `pip install flask` to install flask. 


## Deployment

TODO: how to deploy the project

Run the following in `src/` directory:

`export FLASK_APP=backend`

`flask run`
