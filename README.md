This is the backend code for the CS98 project VisuOL developed during the 21F and 22W.

## Architecture

TODO:  descriptions of code organization and tools and libraries used

So far, we are using Python and Flask for our backend. We are planning to use MongoDB for our backend.

## Setup

TODO: how to get the project dev environment up and running, npm install etc

1. You will need to setup a virtual environment outside of the folder: `python -m venv [env-name]`
2. From the folder activate the virtual environment `source [env-name]/bin/activate`
3. Navigate to the project folder where the requirements.txt file is and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Deployment

TODO: how to deploy the project

After completing setup, 

1. `cd src/`

2. `export FLASK_APP=backend`

3. `flask run`
